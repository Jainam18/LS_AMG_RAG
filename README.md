# Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot for Enterprise

This project focuses on developing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot optimized for enterprise environments. It leverages metadata and lexical search filtering of vector database documents to provide faster, more accurate, and context-aware responses while reducing hallucinations. The chatbot aims to enhance efficiency in enterprise-level information retrieval and decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Enterprises handle massive volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making efficient information retrieval challenging. Existing chatbots often suffer from:

- **Inaccurate Responses:** Generating hallucinated answers due to insufficient context.
- **High Computational Costs:** Inefficient retrieval methods leading to slower performance.
- **Poor Context Awareness:** Inability to leverage enterprise-specific metadata effectively.

The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing an advanced RAG chatbot tailored for enterprise use cases.

## Key Objectives
1. **Improve Response Accuracy:**
   - Minimize hallucinations using metadata-enriched retrieval mechanisms.
   - Employ lexical search to refine document retrieval.

2. **Enhance Computational Efficiency:**
   - Optimize retrieval and generation workflows to reduce latency.

3. **Enterprise-Specific Context:**
   - Enable the chatbot to understand and respond to queries in enterprise-specific domains.

- Employ lightweight and scalable transformer-based models for faster response generation.

### 3. Hallucination Reduction
- Integrate techniques to verify the reliability of retrieved documents before response generation.
- Filter responses based on confidence scores and context alignment.

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- Provide an intuitive interface for users to:
  - Ask complex, domain-specific questions.
  - Obtain detailed, context-aware answers.

## What I Worked On
As the lead developer, my contributions included:

1. **Metadata and Lexical Search Integration:**
   - Designed and implemented a hybrid search mechanism using vector embeddings and lexical filtering.
   - Enhanced retrieval precision by incorporating metadata into the search process.

2. **Optimization of RAG Workflow:**
   - Streamlined the retrieval and generation processes to improve computational efficiency.
   - Conducted performance testing to ensure low latency.

3. **Response Summarization and Hallucination Control:**
   - Implemented algorithms to validate the accuracy of retrieved documents before passing them to the generation model.
   - Added post-generation filtering to eliminate irrelevant or misleading information.

4. **Enterprise Context Adaptation:**
   - Customized the chatbot to handle enterprise-specific terminology and datasets.
   - Developed pipelines to preprocess and structure enterprise documents for optimal retrieval.

## Future Work
- Extend support for multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio, and text).
- Implement dynamic fine-tuning based on user feedback.
- Add multilingual support to cater to global enterprise environments.
- Integrate real-time streaming data for more dynamic insights.
